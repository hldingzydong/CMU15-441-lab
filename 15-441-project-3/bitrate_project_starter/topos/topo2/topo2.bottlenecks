# Each pair of endhosts can be separated by at most one bottleneck link.
# Multiple pairs of endhosts may share the same bottleneck. Bottleneck links
# should be named "link<num>" where <num> is an integer from 1 to 9998 
# (inclusive). You do not need to specify a bottleneck for every pair of 
# endhosts. Bottlenecks are specified as followed:
#
#	<ip1> link<num> <ip2>
#
# IP addresses may be specified in any order and do not need to be specified
# twice (e.g., you do not need both ip1 link1 ip2 AND ip2 link1 ip1).
